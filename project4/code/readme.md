## basic Agent
`python main.py`

runing time : two hours for 256 size

## Improved Agent in numpy
`python main_imp_numpy.py`

all layers and functions are ultilized by numpy, but needs to be modified, computationally terrible and can not converge to sensible result

## Improved Agent in pytorch
`python main_imp_torch.py`

running time : 10mins for 10000 epochs,256 size.
